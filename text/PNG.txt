MSPaint:
	png files directly made with MSPaint arent Parsed properly
	no problem with the Huffman Tree but the Image is wrong
	might be some of those unused Blocks

Workaround:
	if wanted Image is in non-working File
	open a working File (like Test.png) with MSPaint
	resize to wanted Size
	"select all" on wanted in MSPaint
	paste in working MSPaint Image
this seems to increase the of the File
not fully sure what's going on
