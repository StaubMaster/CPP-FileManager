LineCommand Parser
"inside"	LineCommand functions
"outside"	where the LineCommand stuff is used

currently the names need to be checked "outside"
and then the count needs to be checked "outside"
set that stuff in the beginning and then check "inside"



Problem:
some funcitons might "turn on" other functions
so Skin can only be probably parsed once "Skin" is known

make it so "Type" and "FileFormat" are hardcoded inside the Parser

how to other Parsers work
most are just hardcoded
and dont change

maybe Parse "Type" and "FileFormat"
then give that to a "ParserInitFunc"
that then sets all the Functions to use ?



Type and FileFormat are expected to be at the beginning
and can both only have 1 Value

put them together
so the beginning of the File needs to be:
"Type"'\n'"FileFormat"'\n'

for Skin
make Type the Type of Skin
that what it dose already :|

dont have this stuff be hardcoded
isntead have a function called "ParseTypeFileFormat()"
that returns Type and Foramt



DirectoryInfo Collection
	have a collection of Directorys
	then getting a File, look through all the Directorys
	usually User specified stuff should be checked first
	have 2 Lists, User and Auto
	have a way to specify Priority ?



NEW:
the old version ran the loop internally
and needed a referance an object

the new version only loops when requested
so just run the loop until you have what you want
and then keep calling
