Some stuff I made in c++ for chacking, reading and writing Files and Directories.

there is currently no function for writing.

FileContext, DirectoryContext and Image are the main things a User needs to interact with. Everything else is just helper stuff.
Should I chane things so those things are in the "foreground", and everything else is more "hidden" ?
maybe
