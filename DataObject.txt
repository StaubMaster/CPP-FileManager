lost of Object store Data
to allocates a Pointer of stuff
but how should there Pointers be handled between Objects



Bind
	just copy the Pointers
	Destructor does nothing
	Dispose() needs to be called to delete[]

Copy
	allocate a new[] Pointer
	copy data at the Pointer
	Destructor delete[]s
	Dispose() does nothing ?
